# Data_Analytics_and_Viz_Portfolio

This repository contains a PDF compilation of my previous works. It's sort of a summary of the various data analysis projects I've worked on the past few years, with the key diagrams and visualizations that I made.

I cited and linked the tools I used for every visualization I included (apart from the flowchart diagrams, which are trivial to make), and linked to the corresponding GitHub repositories (where available) for more information about the background of the projects, and scripts (if any) used to generate the analysis.

I don't claim to be very good at it (I'm still learning a lot!), but I hope that this demonstrates my passion for data analytics, and visualization!

If you have any questions about any of the work I've done, feel free to reach out to me at jao.c.justin@gmail.com.
